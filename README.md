# fork-resource
A resource to help beginner C programmers visualize the fork() system call through animated examples, code snippets, and explanations. Check out the final project at [fork-resource](https://as0501.github.io/fork-resource/)!

## Why Animations?
One of the toughest parts of tracing the output of a given code snippet that contains fork() calls is being able to draw an accurate diagram to represent the program. Animations allow beginner programmers to visualize these important system calls in real time, allowing them to watch each proccess execute simultaneously and understand how each proccess is affected by additional calls like waitpid() and sleep().

## Reanimate
The animations were created using Reanimate, an animation library written in Haskell and based on SVG. Check out my waitpid() animation in the examples folder in the Reanimate repository!
