# fork-website
A resource to help beginner C programmers visualize the fork() system call through animated examples, code snippets, and explanations. There are 6 examples where programmers can first hand-trace the output, check their answer, and then watch an animated representation of the program. 

##Animations
The animations were created using the Haskell Animation Library: Reanimate. Each animation includes a variety of detailed labels to help programmers understand the program that is being represented.
